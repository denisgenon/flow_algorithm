\section{Build of a DSL}
The Scala language was carefully chosen. Scala is high level and a mixed paradigm language, It uses pure object-oriented and functional programming. As it is statically typed, it allows the writing of Domain Specific Language. Working on a DSL that permits to specify a routing problem in a way that can be used for the Ant could be a serious improvement of this implementation.
