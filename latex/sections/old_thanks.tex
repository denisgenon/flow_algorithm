This thesis represents the culmination of a long and fruitful journey. Over the years I have been blessed with friends and family who have supported and encouraged me. I would like to take the opportunity here to extend my heartfelt thanks and love to all of them. Pursuing my academic program at UCL has been a thoroughly enjoyable experience, full of learning and laughter. There were tougher moments too, and I am especially grateful to my entourage for their faithful friendship which helped me to overcome the challenges along the way. 

To Tanya, my beautiful girlfriend, thank you for your love, your presence and your belief in me. 

To my friends I say thank you for all of the good times we shared together. I look forward to many more of course!

To my family I would like to express my thanks for all of your love and for being a source of constant motivation.

Finally, I would like to give special thanks to my Promoter for his invaluable insights and his supervision. Your help contributed greatly towards the successful completion of this thesis.
